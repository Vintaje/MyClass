HI friend’s
In this tutorial i just want to explain you regarding the friends list database structure . So let’s start
suppose there are the two table one is ” User ” and Other is the ” Friends ” and the Structure something like this
User Table
CREATE TABLE `User` (
`UserId` int(11) NOT NULL,
`Username` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
`Email` varchar(512) NOT NULL,
`Password` text NOT NULL,
`Image` text NOT NULL,
)ENGINE=MyISAM DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1;
And Friends Table
CREATE TABLE `Friends` (
`FriendsId` int(11) NOT NULL,
`UserOne` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
`UserTwo` varchar(512) NOT NULL,
`Status` int(11) NOT NULL,
)ENGINE=MyISAM DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1;
Here i just divide this tutorial into 4 steps that is below
1 ) : Send friend request
2 ) : Check the friend request
3 ) : Update the request status
4 ) : Get the Friends List
Step 1 : — Send friend request
INSERT INTO `Friends`(`FriendsId`, `UserOne`, `UserTwo`, `Status`) VALUES (null,’21',’23',’0');
Here UserOne is the user that currently login and the user that want to send the request to other user , and UserTwo are the other user whom you are sending the friends request . and the UserTwo are the other user that receive your friends request .
Step 2 : — Check the friend request
SELECT * FROM `Friends` AS F , `User` AS U WHERE CASE WHEN F.UserOne = 23 THEN F.UserTwo = U.UserId WHEN F.UserTwo = 23 THEN F.UserOne = U.UserId END AND F.Status = 0 AND GROUP BY U.UserId;
3 ) : Update the request status
UPDATE `Friends` SET `Status`=1 WHERE FriendsId=?
Here you need to update the only Friends table with status value , you can also delete or just update t
he status as per your requirement , in this example i just follow the status like this , if Status = 0 means requested , if Status = 1 means approve , if Status = 2 means rejected , you can change it as per your requirement . In the above query just use the table id instead of ?
4 ) : Get the Friends List
SELECT * FROM `Friends` AS F , `User` AS U WHERE CASE WHEN F.UserOne = 23 THEN F.UserTwo = U.UserId WHEN
F.UserTwo = 23 THEN F.UserOne = U.UserId END AND F.Status = 1 AND GROUP BY U.UserId;
the above query will return all the friend list .
